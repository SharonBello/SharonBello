## ABOUT ME
Self Starter & Quick Learner, Passionate about Coding & Technology. 

I'm a Full Stack developer, who loves to volunteer in social-impact startups, currently working with Primap, a technological platform aimed at helping teenagers with social anxiety. I also volunteer at the SheCodes organization, mentoring other women coders. 

I recently graduated from the Coding Academy bootcamp where I fell in love with React, Angular and other modern web frameworks. 

As a former designer and educator, I am always eager to learn and develop my coding skills. Currently, I'm working on a couple of projects, including an end-to-end Angular project, while getting to know 3d libraries such as Three.js and particles.js. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Primap
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Three.js
- âš¡ Fun fact: In 2003 I showcased my garments during New York Fashion Week
